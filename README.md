# MATH3700ProjectSIR
Code for MATH3700, Final project, about COVID SIR modeling

This repository corresponds to appendix A of Oliver Laufenberg and Yesenia Tavizon's final project.
It contains the code that executed the SIR, SEIR, and SIRI models, and produced plots for them, which would clutter up the report itself.
